# Nightingale

The app can be found in the App Store with the name: PuckBeats


Nightingale is a Swift app designed to play music at its peak!


The app fetches songs from SoundCloud and presents them to the user in a familiar, streaming-style interface similar to Spotify. Instead of traditional playlists, songs are grouped into game-specific playlists such as: Goal and Faceoff


Each song starts playing from a predefined timestamp, skipping directly to the most energetic or recognizable part of the track. This allows instant, high-impact playback that fits the fast pace of a hockey match.
