Nightingale

Nightingale is a Swift app designed to play music during ice hockey matches to enhance the game atmosphere.

The app fetches songs from SoundCloud and presents them to the user in a familiar, streaming-style interface similar to Spotify. Instead of traditional playlists, songs are grouped into game-specific playlists such as:
	•	Goal
	•	Faceoff

Each song starts playing from a predefined timestamp, skipping directly to the most energetic or recognizable part of the track. This allows instant, high-impact playback that fits the fast pace of a hockey match.

Features
	•	Built in Swift
	•	Uses Firebase for data storage and configuration
	•	Fetches music from SoundCloud
	•	Game-event–based playlists
	•	Precise playback starting points per song
